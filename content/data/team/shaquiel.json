    "bio": "Hey there, I’m Shaquiel – a business strategist, marketer, and world explorer. Born and raised in South Africa, I’ve spent the last few years living and working across different continents, currently based in Bangkok while pursuing a Bachelor’s in Business Administration with a focus on High Tech Entrepreneurship. With a background in digital marketing and entrepreneurship, I bring a unique global perspective to everything I do. From analyzing data and developing strategies to soaking in the views from a rooftop bar in Barcelona, my approach is always driven by creativity and results. My heart beats for marketing, and I’ve had the privilege of working with some amazing companies and brands. Plus, I speak four languages, which is my secret weapon when it comes to building relationships across cultures.\n",
